This WheePin chrome extentison will be a compliment to BookMark of Chrome browser. 

We will generate a combine page of all your saved pages (with abstract and spapshot of each saved page). 

Goal:
The reason I built this chrome extension is, sometimes I read some tech blog, but I don't have enough time to finish reading, but by saving to bookmark, I usually forget to read them anymore. 
Thus, I want to have a "portfolio" page for all my saveForLater blogs, so I can keep track of blogs I need to finish in the next few days.
